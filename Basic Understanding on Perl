/* Basic Level of Understanding about PERL /*

PERL- Practical Extraction and Reporting Language
C:\perl_test>perl -v   // To know whether perl is installed on ur machine and what is the version It will show 

The very first line of your perl file must be
#!/usr/bin/perl   // To indicate that it is perl and getting executed

Its an interpreter, you can get the output immediately after run. Not like c-program.
#This is the comment line in perl. Need to use hash symbol before the line
#!/usr/bin/perl  // This is not a comment line

Cat filename.pl  // It will show the whole program command prompt.

To use mathematic function, we need to use as below.
#!/usr/bin/perl
use Math::Trig;
